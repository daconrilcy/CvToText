Globe trotter
Iʼve traveled across the United States from 
East to West by motorcycle, traversed South-ern and Eastern Africa in a 4x4, and sailed the Cyclades. Donʼt get me started on this topic 
unless you have two hours to spare.

I can jump 15 meters high. However, my 
friends, probably out of jealousy, claim that I 
only exceed a meter by accident.
